# NEGM
This repository mainly contains the central function of the NEGM algorithm and four real network datasets.

NEGM_FUNCTION: the central function of the NEGM algorithm

Experimental tool: Pycharm

Programming language: Python

The four datasets used by the NEGM algorithm mainly include SARS network, Mouse network, Yeast network and Human network. Each network contains two files, one file is used to describe the topology of the network, and the other file records the relatively important nodes of the network.
